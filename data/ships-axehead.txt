	description "The Scimitar is the most greatest crown of Axehead Industries. It is based off an old Triacrom design, and improved on. Javelin Labs has made its alternative, yet it is not as powerful."
	description "	There are several variants of the Scimitar, namely the Mod Scimitar and the Scimitar Longsword. It is disputed whether the Katana is a Scimitar, as they were in design around the same time."

	description "The Mod Scimitar features pulled-back wings, allowing more ports to be placed on. The wings have also been fitted with an extra engine port, letting it gain extra speed. It also has a larger shield, which gives it a high advantage over its base."
