	`	As you are piloting your ship down to land on <planet>, James disappears into his bunk room. After the ship has landed he comes out, no longer in the grease-stained coveralls he's been wearing up until now, but in a suit. As a lifelong textile worker, you automatically note that the suit is made of real wool, very finely woven, and that it has been tailored to fit him. He smooths down the front of the suit distractedly and then looks at his hands as if unsure of where to put them. "How do I look?" he asks.`

	`	There's an awkward pause. You're unsure of how to respond. Then he says, "Thing is, this here planet is one of the most exclusive retirement communities in the galaxy. Plenty of the locals are probably worth more than a billion credits. But they're mostly financial or business types, or old money. I'm rich enough to be here, but I just hope they're willing to socialize with someone who made his fortune flying a ship.`

	`	"Stay near Sol and around the Paradise Worlds. The Navy stays there the most, so even if a pirate does show up, they won't last long. The Deep is also a pretty safe place, as they have their own security forces. Once you start moving farther south, things get riskier. The worlds down there don't bring in as much tax revenue as the Paradise Worlds do, so the Navy tends to ignore them. You'll find some local militia to back you up, but they're nothing compared to one of the Navy's Cruisers.`

	`	"Well to start off, you'll want to stay right here in the Paradise Worlds. The asteroids aren't the best, but it's the safest place to mine while you're still in a small ship. But once you're in something that's able to take a hit, you'll want to explore for an uninhabited system with lots of asteroids. You'll encounter more pirates, but you'll likely find better asteroids.`

	`	"I've spoken with the Quarg a few times, but what captain hasn't? You'll find them down south by Tarazed. I also have heard of some more aliens," he pauses for a moment, "there's a wormhole in Wei, south of the Dirt Belt. There are a lot of aliens after the wormhole, or so I'm told. I've only seen a few of the 'Triacrom'. I think they are just one wormhole past the Wei one.`

	`	"One of the most reliable trade routes is to bring food from the Dirt Belt to Earth or the other urban worlds around it. There are billions of mouths to feed on those worlds, and the Dirt Belt sells food for cheap, so it's a great place to get started. Just remember though that if you use the same trade route for too long, you might end up causing the prices to stabilize. The Dirt Belt can only produce food and people can only eat it so fast, so change up your trade routes if you notice the return getting worse.`

	`	"Getting good jobs is more about having the space to accept the good jobs than it is finding them, but if you're looking for jobs that pay well for little effort, then you'll want to watch out around the holidays. There's always a big celebration on Earth every April 22nd, Earth Day, so pay attention to the job board in the months leading up to that. The people down in the Rim have some month-long celebration every August that you should look out for too.`
