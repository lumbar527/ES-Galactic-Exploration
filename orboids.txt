Orboids:

A race of alien orb-eye things that the Orboid Worshipers worship, not because they believe in divine nature but because of the power of the Orboids. (They have actually been enslaved by the Orboids)

The Orboids have a single weapon, an Orboid Beam that turns them red and is very dangerous. The Orboid Worshipers have ships like the Gold, and Silver Orboid. (The ships are called that and have the color.)

Storyline:

Orboid Worshiper revolt.
